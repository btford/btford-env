# btford-env

Minimalist Dotfiles + Configs for doing things the way I do them.


## Install

**WARNING** This install script will overwrite existing configs.
In general it will prompt before doing so, but you should carefully backup any existing files before running this.

To install:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:btford/btford-env.git btford-env
cd $_
./boostrap.sh
```

...and follow the prompts

## The Setup

Most things are symlinked from this dir to their target.
Includes the following things:

### Zsh

Everything in one file for now.


### Git

`.gitconfig` includes my name and email.
You probably should change that if you use this.


### App

App-specific settings.
Most of these will be simlinked into their proper homes.

#### Sublime Text 3


### Font
